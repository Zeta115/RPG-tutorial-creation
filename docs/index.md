# Welcome to the RPG tutorial creation research


# Introduction


In this page you're going to find a personal research about the RPG tutorials with some good and bad examples as well as a guide on how to make your own tutorial with good advises.

From what i can gather, the book "Learn to play: Designing tutorials for video games" is a great start into the understanding of what is a tutorial itself and how to implement them more naturaly. The author's book, Mathew M. White, has years of studies in psychology, education in the video game department, human-computer interaction and user interface experience han he compiles all his experience to help game designers to make their game's tutorials feel more dynamic. The book allso offers easy to implement changes to help your educate new players into your game and engage the more experienced playerbase.

The key questions when playing the tutorial of a game are: What am I doing? How do I do it? And why am I doing it?

If your tutorial does not answer these specific questions you may consider changing it a bit.

# Market Study

Since you have to do a market study before launching your game some good advises i'm seeing online are:

- First of all, inspect your own game, wich genres does it have?

- We are going for an RPG with clasic combat involving turns as mechanics.

- Do not look for those games everyone knows or why they did succed in the first place.

- Instead look for those game that over perfomed, those no one knew that even existed in the first place but now have a great revenue.

- Hype is a double edged sword, handle it carefully.

- Listen to the fans of the genres itselves, try to figure out the key mechanics everyone loves/hates.

# Selected aproach

- The tutorial should present every key feature of your game, it can be more or less obvious inside the story, but you should try to implement a tutorial that also goes with the game's story

As we will see later, diferent RPGs have other ways of implementing its tutorial.


# Posible Improvements




## Comparison between one rpg game tutorial vs a non rpg game



### Terraria's tutorial



- For the non RPG game we will take "Terraria", the game is listed in steam as a Sandbox-Survival game and we can say it's also a action-adventure game


![](images/Tutorial_spawn.jpg)
(Terraria's tutorial for 3ds)

As we can see in the image the game shows you the ropes with kick guides in the inferior part of the screen such as how to open your inventory.

Terraria's tutorial also features a pre-scipted world helping you find diferent objects to get used to the game's mechanics.

- As for a good RPG game tutorial we will take Persona 5 Royale.

The game starts in the middle of the action(later on discovered as a fast forward), guiding you through a small later section of the game, it teaches you how to move around in diferent modes and what to do in fights, eting you target your enemies weakneses.

### Persona 5 Royale battle tutorial:

Your main objective to achieve easy to win battles is go for the hold up mode, in this mode all enemies are downed and you have 3 options, but there's only 2 usefull ones, those being:

- All Out attack.

This is an attack involving all of your teamates to deal massive damage to all your enemies, easy to end battles

- Talk mechanic.

With this you can threaten your enemies so that they give you money, items or their own power. (This mechanic is not seen in the tutorial as it is intended to let you see the All out attack).

## Welcome to the RPG tutorial creation research

In this page you're going to find a personal research about the RPG tutorials with some good and bad examples as well as a guide on how to make your own tutorial with good advises

From what i can gather, the book "Learn to play: Designing tutorials for video games" is a great start into the understanding of what is a tutorial itself and how to implement them more naturaly. The author's book, Mathew M. White, has years of studies in psychology, education in the video game department, human-computer interaction and user interface experience han he compiles all his experience to help game designers to make their game's tutorials feel more dynamic. The book allso offers easy to implement changes to help your educate new players into your game and engage the more experienced playerbase.

### Comparison between one rpg game tutorial vs a non rpg game

For the non RPG game we will take "Terraria", the game is listed in steam as a Sandbox-Survival game and we can say it's also a action-adventure game

(Terraria's tutorial for 3ds)

As we can see in the image the game shows you the ropes with kick guides in the inferior part of the screen such as how to open it's inventory.
